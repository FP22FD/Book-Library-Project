## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Book-Library Project** is an internal book catalog application that allows users to browse and view details of books imported from the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) dataset. This is **not an e-commerce platform** but rather a learning project focused on:

- Building a clean, scalable full-stack application
- Implementing modern development practices
- Exploring cloud technologies and DevOps workflows
- Demonstrating proficiency in C# (.NET) and React

**Key Features:**
- Import and display books from Open Library dataset
- Browse book catalog with pagination
- View detailed information about individual books
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- RESTful API architecture

---

## 🎯 MVP Definition

**MVP = Book Catalog (not e-commerce)**

The Minimum Viable Product focuses on a simple, working application with the following principles (defined in meeting 16.01.2026):

- ✅ **Backend-first approach** – Prioritize API and data layer
- ✅ **C# (.NET) backend** – All backend logic in C#
- ✅ **Mock data initially** – Start with in-memory data, then transition to database
- ✅ **Local database (Docker)** – Database is optional in the very beginning
- ✅ **No Azure requirement for MVP** – Cloud deployment is a nice-to-have

**Core MVP Deliverables:**
1. Backend API with book endpoints (GET /books, GET /books/{id})
2. Data import console app (C#) to load 50-100 books from Open Library
3. React frontend displaying book list and detail pages
4. Basic responsive UI with routing

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Strategy: Mobile-First Approach
- UI and layout are designed starting from **mobile screens**
- Desktop and larger screens are handled via **responsive design**
- Ensures better usability and scalability across devices

📖 **Reference:** [MDN - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)

### Backend Strategy: Code First with Entity Framework Core
- Database schema is **generated from C# domain models**
- **Migrations** are used to evolve the database
- Enables faster iteration and easier refactoring during development
- Follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns

📖 **References:**
- [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core)
- [Clean Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#clean-architecture)
- [Dependency Injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for local database)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 🧪 Local Development Setup

#### 📦 Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd ./BooksLibrary/BooksLibrary.client
npm i
```

🐘 Start Local Database (PostgreSQL + Adminer)

Start containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Stop containers:

```bash 
docker compose down
```

🖥️ Access Adminer UI

Open in your browser:

```bash 
http://localhost:8080
```
Login:

System: PostgreSQL
Server: db
Username: postgres
Password: secret
Database: (leave blank to see all databases)    

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FP22FD/Book-Library-Project.git
   cd Book-Library-Project
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Configure Connection Strings**
   - Use [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) for local development:
     ```bash
     dotnet user-secrets init
     dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "your-connection-string"
     ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**
   - see [README.md](./BooksLibrary.Database/README.md)

5. **Run the Backend**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or configured port)

6. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port)

7. **Import Book Data** (Console App)
   ```bash
   cd ../console-import
   dotnet run
   ```
   This will import 50-100 books from the Open Library dataset into your database.

### Running with Docker (Optional)

```bash
# Start database container
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name book-library-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  postgres:latest
```

## 🧭 Final Recommendation

> **Focus first on: C# Backend + Data Import + Simple Frontend**
> 
> Advanced features (SignalR, Queues, Terraform, Aspire) are **explicitly optional** and should only be considered if time allows after MVP completion.

**Recommended Development Order:**
1. ✅ Setup repository and project management
2. ✅ Backend API with mock data
3. ✅ Database setup with EF Core migrations
4. ✅ Console app for data import
5. ✅ Frontend book list and detail pages
6. ⚠️ Testing (backend + frontend)
7. ⚠️ Azure deployment
8. ✨ Advanced features (based on time and interest)
